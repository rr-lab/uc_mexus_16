Line 81: LRBD was defined in the abstract but it should be defined again the first time is mentioned in the main text.

Line 92: A simple description of SimRoot could be included here, or at least direct the reader to the materials and methods section where more information is provided I think it would also be helpful to include a link to the authors webpage where ample information about the model is provided.
I think it would be  helpful if the authors could comment on how their model compares/complements with other models that focus on hormone (specially auxin) production, transport signaling at a more local scale (primary root tip and lateral root emergence. This would reviewer would like to know from the authors if there is a possibility of integrating these different models.

Line 118: First figure mentioned in the text should be figure 1. Figure 1 is mentioned in materials and methods but these go at the end of the manuscript.

Line 128-130: This sentence is confuse. If uptake is calculated by the Vmax of MM uptake kinetics when nutrient concentrations were very high, how is then uptake calculated when nutrient concentrations are low. Please clarify

Line 134: can the authors provide data or reference to support this statement?

Line 150: Same as in the previous comment. The authors say mention shoot growth rates but these values are not given anywhere.

Line 168: What are these consequences?

Line 199: The authors mention simulations where both nitrate and phosphorus uptake are run simultaneously and comment on this data. However the values of such simulations (I suppose is Figure 8) are not referenced here.

Line 222: than should be then.

Line 290: delete that at the end of the line.

Line 294: I suggest to change This is necessitated by This is due to

Line 337: The authors might want to use recent data published by the Gloria Coruzzi lab (DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1305883110) in this section
They identified PHO1 (xylem PO4 loading) as one of the genes explaining root plasticity.

Line 443: I don{\textasciiacute}t understand this. If there is no repetition there is no need to smooth the variation, but then we are not taking into account stochastic effects.

Figure 2: Could the authors explain why they choose those specific nutrient regime values?
In panel A I cannot see the line for 104 kg. ha-1. Is it overlapping with the line of 208? Is really difficult to see. All the symbols in the legend appear to be filled, but then in the graph they look like open when they are overlapping with their line.
I suggest to use color. See for example Supplemental Figure S4. Same amount of lines, but much less confusing. Remember that Plant Physiology is not charging for color figure starting Jan 2014: http://www.plantphysiol.org/site/misc/ifora.xhtml
Letters A and B should be clearly differentiated from the title of the graph.
Separate kg. from ha-1
x-axis tittle should be number of lateral branches.
What do the authors mean by PO4, I guess it is PO43- anions.

Figure 3 and 4: I think this figure could be combined with number 2 to make a 6 panel figure with nitrate regimes on the top and phosphorus regimes at the bottom. This would solve the problem of having a figure caption referring to another figure.

Figure 8. Why the values available nitrate are not the same as in figure 2?
I think figure captions should be


Figure S6. Please use white, gray and black filled bars instead of the patterns used. Patterned bars are know to distort the perception of the actual sizes of bars. The caption mentions 0.5 or 3.0 kg of PO4 in solution but then the x axis label says 0.17 and 0.50. Is not actually clear the notation in the x axis label 0.17=Kg.ha-1??? I don{\textasciiacute}t understand.}
