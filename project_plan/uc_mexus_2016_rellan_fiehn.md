# The role of phospholipids in maize adaptation to highlands of Mexico

## Background

The ancestor of maize (*Zea mays ssp.Mexicana*),teosinte, is native to southeast Mexico, specifically from the Balsas River Valley at a low altitude, located in Guerrero state. This specie is known as teosinte *parviglumis* (*Zea mays ssp.Parviglumis*). There is another subspecies of teosinte named as *Mexican* (*Zea mays ssp.Mexicana*), which colonized the highlands of Mexico over 1800 meters. Maize (*Zea mays ssp. mays*) was domesticated from *parviglumis* about 8,000 years ago in nearby the low valleys where *parviglumis* origintaed [@Matsuoka:2002fh]. From that region the maize spread throughout Mexico, the rest of the Americas and nowadays it grows on every continent except Antarctica [@Hake:2015cx]. 
Therefore, maize represents a very appropriate model to study local adaptation processes. 
Local adaptation can be defined as the mechanisms of how plants modify their metabolism to develop in the biotic and abiotic conditions of the ecological niche they occupy. So, after its domestication in the Balsas River, maize colonized mexican highlands, where it was exposed to higher levels of radiation, lower air pressure, temperature and precipitation; furthermore, in some areas close to the Mexican volcanoes chain, maize had to adapt to Andosol soils, characterized by low bio-availability of phosphorus [@Krasilnikov:2013wua]. During the process of adaptation to highlands, it is thought that many of the characteristics that allowed adaptation of maize were the result of introgression events with teosinte *mexicana*, which was already adapted to these highland conditions [@Hufford:2013im].

A remarkable metabolic change in most plants adapted to low temperature conditions is the increase of phospholipids proportion in the composition of membranes, with respect to other lipids such as galactolipids and sulfolipids [@Degenkolbe:2012dp]. On the other hand, plants adapted to phosphorus deficiency, tend to degrade phospholipids in order to recycle phosphate; the phospholipids are replaced with galactolipids and sulfolipids. In highlands, due to the strong environmental pressure, maize has adapted to use phospholipids efficiently as possible. Although the metabolic pathways involved in these processes are more or less known, recent results suggest that the diversity of polar lipids involved may be greater than we expect [@Okazaki:2013dw].

There are several studies that point to an important role of phospholipids in maize highland adaptation. Takuno and colleagues studied genes showing marks maize selective breeding populations highlands in Mesoamerica and South America [@Takuno:2015cr]. Genes that showed marks of adaptation to highlands in the two groups only agreed a group of about 90 genes. When performed a search on Gene Ontology over a third of the terms found were related to the synthesis of lipids / phospholipids. Furthermore, one of these genes is described as a CONSTANS interacting protein, a transcription factor that is upstream of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), which control flowering time according to photoperiod.
The flowering locus T (FT) protein, in *Arabidopsis thaliana*, has been found to specifically bind phoshatidylcholine (PtdCho) *in vitro*, having a direct correlation between PtdCho levels and flowering time [@Nakamura:2014gs]. When the proportion of PtdCho is increased, relative to the phosphoethanolamine (PEA), flowering time is probably reduced because the FT complex with PtdCho favors the union of FT to genes controlling and accelerating flowering. Additionally, both PtdCho and other intermediate metabolites of PtdCho synthesis are essential for proper embryo development [@Lin:2015ef]. 
In maize, it has also been shown that lipid profiles can be used as good predictors of the flowering time [@Riedelsheimer:2012ir].

In this project we are proposing the use different approaches for understanding the role of phospholipids in the adaptation of maize to the mexican highlands.

## Hypothesis

Basic assumption of this proposal is that phospholipids have played a key role in the adaptation of maize to the highlands of Mexico.

## Justification

This pre-proposal is considered as a border between combining genetic approaches using quantitative techniques, molecular biology, population genetics, evolutionary genetics and polar lipid analysis with liquid chromatography techniques coupled to mass spectrometry and use of libraries of mass spectra of lipids .
Also,it is necessary to develop controlled experiments, in fields, that match the natural environments in which these adaptation processes originally arise. It should highlight the importance of combining these approaches here in Mexico, which is an advantage over other groups working on similar projects.

As results of this project, understanding the role of phospholipids in response to phosphorus deficiency is key for developing new strategiesle that may be used to design basic improvement projects of maize races or to specifically incorporate desirable traits in maize hybrids.
At present there are few projects studying local adaptation phenomena, this due to researches have focused on specific processes using local adapatation just as a complementary approach to understand other processes. The current basic science project we are working in, is studying some of these issues using as the model of study *Arabidopsis*, nevertheless, maize is the main C4 crop worldwide, reason enough to directly study all thse processes in it. 

## General Objective

The general objective of this proposal is to characterize the changes in lipid profiles and genetic changes which explain maize genotypes adapted to highlands of Mexico in connection with genotypes adapted to low valleys.

## Specific Objectives

1. Characterize the profile of phospholipids and other polar lipids; as well as the expression patterns of genes involved in the synthesis of those lipids in B73 maize plants and Toluqueño Dovecote (low valleys race).
For these analyses, a growing experiment will be performed in a growth chamber simulating weather conditions of highlands and low valleys, mainly regulating the chamber's temperature (10 °C for highlands conditions and 25 °C for low valleys) and photoperiod. In this experiment, the plants are grown for a period of 2-3 weeks, along that time samples will be taken from different parts of the plant, such as different types of sheets. 
Once achieved this objective, is expected to obtain a map of the quantities and types of phospholipids in different genotypes adapted to high and low valleys, which will be really helpful to decide at which developmental stage and from which structure is more convinient for sampling the experimental fields. 

2. Characterize the genetic architecture of phospholipid metabolism, in order to identify regions of the genome (QTLs) and/ or genes that may be ruling re-organization of polar lipids in response to conditions of highlands.

3. Study the ifferentiation signals of genes involved in the synthesis of phospholipids, glycerolipids and sulpholipids between maize races of highlands and low valleys.

4. Analyze the effects of abnormal levels of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) on the  flowering time, in conditions of highlands and low valleys.

5. Study what is the effect of natural variation in genes involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), on the expression of lipids and other phenotypes such as flowering time. 

## Relevant Methodology

1. Lipid analysis will be performed in collaboration with Professor Oliver Fiehn from Metabolomics laboratory at UC Davis. 
The maize samples are extracted according to the method of Matyash et al. [[12]](https://paperpile.com/c/X0kwCD/P5Jx)
Separation and identification of lipids will be accomplished using a method that has been optimized, in the laboratory of Oliver Fiehn, with UPLC-QTOFMS electrospray on modes negative and positive. The method allows the identification of about 500 types of lipids including phospholipids, galactolipids, and sulfolipids. Further identification was complemented using LipidBlast data base [[11]](https://paperpile.com/c/X0kwCD/TgQL).

2. For this objective, a mapping population developed by the laboratory of Ruairidh Sawers will be analyzed. This population is composed by 100 RILS (Recombinant Inbred Lines) BC2S4 (Backcross twice with B73 and then selfed during four generations), from a cross of B73 (reference line) with Toluqueño Dovecote (maize breed adapted to highlands). 
Based on the results obtained in the above objective, samples of plants grown in an experimental field of Bucerias (50 meters above sea level, lower valley) and other field in Metepec (2600 m.a.s.l, high valley) will be taken at the same stage of development.
Once taken the maize samples, lipid profiles will be analyzed and used for a QTL analysis with R/QTL program [[13]] (https://paperpile.com/c/X0kwCD/Csme). The concentrations of each of the lipid types, and the ratios between different environments (Metepec vs Bucerias) are going to be used as the phenotype.
A future goal is to do the same analysis using a NAM mapping population (Nested Association Mapping), also created by R. Sawers Laboratory, where 15 races of highlands maize have crossed with CML312 hybrid which will allow to capture a wider range of alleles from a larger number of parents. 
It is expected to identify genes that fall within identified QTL regions, then, mutants for the candidate genes will be developed by using insertional mutant lines UniformMu or Ac / Ds. 
Alternatively, mutants using the CRISPR-CAS9 technology will be develop in collaboration with the laboratory of Luis Herrera-Estrella at LANGEBIO.

3. For this purpose the genomes to be used (with a depth of sequencing 30X) are from 30 races of maize grown in high and low valleys, not published yet but available in the laboratory of Jeffrey Ross-Ibarra. 
With these data, Fst ​​and Pi values will be calculated to assess the diversity in the sequences of the genes (and their corresponding regulatory elements) involved in the synthesis of phospholipids,also, data will be analyzed to check if there are marks of selection (low diversity) along the races adapted to highlands, which would indicate that these genes have been evolutionarily selected as beneficial for conditions of highlands.

4. In order check the possible effects, under field conditions, of changing levels of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho)/phosphoethanolamine (PE) in flowering times [[8]](https://paperpile.com/c/X0kwCD/BP7V), crosses will be made ​​between UniformMu insertional mutants in genes XIPOTL and RILS of the population B73xPT, only the ones which present  extreme flowering times, both in high and low valleys conditions. After these crosses are made, they will again grow under the same conditions to evaluate the effects of the mutation in flowering times.

5. For this point, the data obtained at objective 3 will be also used.
On one hand, the genes which have been found to present differentiation will be selected and re-sequenced, along the 30 maize races group. Having these data, genetic expression studies will be possible using real-time PCR, in order to verify if differentiation levels correspond with expression levels.
The coding regions of genes from highlands and low valleys with higher levels of differentiation will be cloned and expressed in mutants of Arabidopsis orthologous genes, this under the control of the endogenous promoter of Arabidopsis. Done this, genetic natural variation of lipids and other phenotypes, as flowering time, can be evaluated using a neutral background (Arabidopsis mutant)
This will evaluate on a neutral background (mutant arabidopsis) the effects of natural variation of these genes in lipid levels and other phenotypes such as flowering time and root development.
In order to achieve this objective we will maintain collaboration with Fulgencio Alatorre laboratory, in the Graduate College of Campeche, and Alfredo Cruz Ramirez laboratory at LANGEBIO.

## Expected Results

This project is expected to clarify to what extent the phospholipid metabolism is involved in the adaptation of maize to highlands in Mexico. The results of the various goals complement each other, but represent independent units that will lead to individual deliverables.

1. A map of the phospholipids content and expression will be obtained, this along different maize developmental stages.

2. Genetic architecture of  phospholipids synthesis will be obtained trough QTLs identification. Within two years, time that is being proposed for this project, may be difficult to map finely potential candidates and test their function, but this can be achieved on possible extensions of the project.

3. Data on the differentiation of the genes involved in synthesis of phospholipids will be obtained, which may explain adaptation to highlands.

4. Design of mutants with altered phosphatidylcholine levels, with which, field data can be obtained to explore the effects of the levels of phosphatidylcholine in flowering times and the consequences in terms of adaptation to highlands.

5. Data generated will help to verify if natural variation in the sequences of the genes involved in phospholipid synthesis have effects on the expression levels, the phospholipids content and other phenotypes, such as flowering time and root development, that are controlled by the phospholipid levels.
