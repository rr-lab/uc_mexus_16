# The role of phospholipids in maize adaptation to highlands of Mexico

## Background

The ancestor of maize*(Zeamays ssp.*Mexicana),teosinte, is native to the Balsas River Valley in the state of Guerrero at low altitude. This specie is known as teosinte *parviglumis* (Zea*mays ssp.*Parviglumis)There is another subspecie of teosinte *Mexican *(Zea*mays ssp.*Mexicana)that colonized the highlands of Mexico over 1800 meters. Maize was domesticated from *parviglumis * about 8,000 years ago in nearby low valleys to the original area *parviglumis* [@Matsuoka:2002fh]. From there the maize spread throughout Mexico, the rest of the Americas and nowadays it grows on every continent except Antarctica [@Hake:2015cx]. maize represents therefore a very appropriate system to study phenomena of local adaptation model, this is how plants modify their metabolism to develop an adequate manner to live in the biotic and abiotic conditions of the ecological niches they occupy. Maize after its domestication in the Balsas River in the highlands of Mexico where he met with some higher levels of radiation, lower air pressure, temperature and precipitation and in some areas near the chain of Mexican volcanoes soil Andosólicos very colonized low availability of phosphorus [@Krasilnikov:2013wua].During the process of adaptation to highlands, it is thought that many of the characteristics that allowed adaptation of maize were the result of introgression events *Mexico,* which was already adapted to these conditions [@Hufford:2013im].

A remarkable metabolic change in most plants adapted to low temperature conditions is the way they have increased the phospholipids proportion in the composition of membranes with respect to other lipids such as galactolipids and sulfolipids [@Degenkolbe:2012dp]. On the other hand, plants adapted to phosphorus deficiency, tend to degrade phospholipids and phosphate to recycle; the phospholipids are replaced with galactolipids and sulfolipids. We are therefore in a position of highlands to strong environmental pressure to use phospholipids efficiently as possible. Although the metabolic pathways involved in these processes are more or less known, recent results suggest that the diversity of polar lipids involved may be greater than we expect [@Okazaki:2013dw].

There are several studies that point to a fundamental role of phospholipids in maize highland adaptation. Takuno and colleagues studied genes showing marks maize selective breeding populations highlands in Mesoamerica and South America [@Takuno:2015cr]. Genes that showed marks of adaptation to highlands, in the two groups, only agreed a group of about 90 genes. When searched on Gene Ontology over a third of the terms found were related to the synthesis of lipids / phospholipids. Furthermore, one of these genes is described as a CONSTANS interacting protein, a transcription factor that is upstream of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), which control flowering time integrating photoperiod information. In Arabidopsis, it has been shown to binds FT phosphatidylcholine [@Nakamura:2014gs]. When the proportion of phosphatidylcholine is increased, relative to the phosphoethanolamine, flowering time is probably reduced because the FT complex with phosphatidylcholine favors the union of FT to genes controlling and accelerating flowering. Furthermore, both phosphatidylcholine and other intermediate metabolites of phosphatidylcholine synthesis are essential for proper embryo development [@Lin:2015ef]   Maize has also been shown that lipid profiles are good predictors of flowering time [@Riedelsheimer:2012ir].

In this project we are proposing the use of different approaches for understanding the role of phospholipids in the adaptation of maize to the mexican highlands.

## Hypothesis

basic assumption of this proposal is that phospholipids have played a key role in the adaptation of maize to the highlands of Mexico.

## Justification

is considered that this pre-proposal is border by combining genetic approaches using quantitative techniques, molecular biology, population genetics, evolutionary genetics, polar lipid analysis with liquid chromatography techniques coupled to mass spectrometry and use of libraries of mass spectra of lipids . Also controlled laboratory experiments in fields that match the natural environments in which these processes should be combined experiments originally arise. It should highlight the importance of combining these approaches here in Mexico, which is an advantage over other groups working on similar projects.

The possible applications that can be derived from the results of this project may be used in basic improvement projects maize races or to incorporate desirable traits in maize hybrids.

Few projects interested in phenomena of local adaptation as they focus on specific processes and used as complementary approaches such as those being proposed here.

Right now it is enjoying a science project Basic that is focused on the role of phospholipids in response to phosphorus deficiency. The approaches and the environmental impact (height) is being proposed to study this proposal is very different. Also in the draft basic science most of the work is being done in Arabidopsis

## General Objective

The general objective of this proposal is to characterize changes in lipid profiles with genetic changes that explain maize genotypes adapted to highlands of Mexico in connection with genotypes adapted to low valleys.

## Specific Objectives

1. To characterize the profile of phospholipids and other polar lipids and the expression patterns of genes involved in the synthesis of B73 maize plants, and Toluqueño Dovecote (low valleys race) in growth chamber conditions simulating weather conditions of highlands and low valleys mainly handling the culture temperature: 10 degrees valleys high and valleys low 25 degrees. Seedling samples 2-3 weeks of age of different types of sheets and along the sheet will be taken. With this first objective will be achieved to obtain a map of the quantities and types of phospholipids in genotypes adapted to high and low valleys that facilitate the choice of fabric and stage of development in samples taken in field experiments

2. characterize the architecture phospholipid metabolism genetics to identify regions of the genome (QTL) and / or genes that may be ruling remodeling polar lipids in response to conditions of highlands.

3. Check for differentiation signals in genes involved in the synthesis of phospholipids and other related as glycerolipids sulpholipids between races and maize highlands and low valleys.lipid

4. Checkabnormalities phosphatidylcholine levels affecting flowering times in conditions of highlands and low valleys.

5. Check if the natural variation genes involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine involve phenotypic changes at the level of lipids, expression of genes involved in their synthesis and other phenotypes that may be related as flowering time.

## Relevant

1. Methodology lipid analysis will be performed in collaboration with Professor Oliver Fiehn. The samples were extracted according to the method of Matyash et al. [[12].](https://paperpile.com/c/X0kwCD/P5Jx)Then they will separate and identify lipids using a method that has been optimized in the laboratory of Oliver Fiehn with UPLC-QTOFMS modes of electrospray negative and positive. The method allows the identification about 500 different types of lipids including phospholipids, galactolipids, and sulfolipids. Further identification was complemented using LipidBlast base [[11]](https://paperpile.com/c/X0kwCD/TgQL)data.

2. To this end, a mapping population developed by the laboratory Ruairidh composed Sawers 100 RILS (recombinant lines) BC2S4 (backcross with B73 twice and then selfed employ four generations ) from a cross of B73 (reference line) with Toluqueño Dovecote (maize breed adapted to highlands). Based on the results obtained in the above objective, samples of plants grown in an experimental field of Bucerias (50 m, lower valley) and another in Metepec (2600 m, high valley) in the same stage of development will be taken. Lipid profiles were then analyzed and used for QTL analysis with R / QTL [[13]](https://paperpile.com/c/X0kwCD/Csme) Using the concentrations of each of the lipids, and the ratios between different environments (Metepec vs Bucerias like phenotype. Later the mapping population NAM (Nested Association Mapping) type being developed by the laboratory of R. Sawers be used where 15 races have crossed maize hybrid highlands CML312 and allow you to capture wider range of alleles from a larger number of parents. possible genes that fall within QTL regions identified mutants were identified and developed to candidate genes using mutant lines insertional UniformMu or Ac / Ds. Alternatively will develop mutants using the CRISPR-CAS9 technology in collaboration with the laboratory of Luis Herrera-Estrella in Langebio.

3. For this purpose the genomes will be used (with a depth of sequencing 30X) of 30 races of maize of high and low valleys still not published and available in the laboratory of Jeffrey Ross-Ibarra. With these data Fst values ​​and Pi will be calculated to assess the diversity in the sequences of the genes (and their corresponding regulatory elements) involved in the synthesis of phospholipids and check if there are checkmarks (low diversity) in the races adapted to highlands which would indicate that these genes have been evolutionarily selected as beneficial for conditions of highlands.

4. In order check the possible effects under field conditions of changing levels of phosphatidylcholine / phosphoethanolamine in flowering times [[8]](https://paperpile.com/c/X0kwCD/BP7V) crosses were made ​​between UniformMu insertional mutants in genes RILS XIPOTL and the population B73xPT submit flowering times both extreme conditions of highlands as low valleys. After these crosses have again grown under the same conditions to evaluate the effects of the mutation in flowering times.

5. Differentiation data between high and low valleys valleys obtained in the target 3. This target will be used different experiments arise. On the one hand those genes for which have found signs of differentiation and in all races resecuenciarán maize group of 30 for which data are available and sequencing as well as other races available in the laboratory of Ruairidh Sawers will be selected. With these data, the data can be refined differentiation between highlands and lowlands. After testing expression of these genes is made ​​by means of real-time PCR races at greatest levels of differentiation to check the levels of differentiation correspond to expression levels. Moreover the coding regions of genes of breeds highlands and low valleys with higher levels of differentiation will be cloned and expressed in mutants of Arabidopsis orthologous genes under the control of the endogenous promoter of Arabidopsis. This will evaluate on a neutral background (mutant arabidopsis) the effects of natural variation of these genes in lipid levels and other phenotypes such as flowering time, etc for root development which have been reported. We will cooperate in this aim laboratories Fulgencio Alatorre in the Graduate College of Campeche and Alfredo Cruz Ramirez Langebio.

## Expected Results

This project is expected to clarify to what extent the phospholipid metabolism is involved in the adaptation of maize to highlands from Mexico. The results of the various goals complement each other but represent independent units that will lead to individual deliverables.

1. A map of the phospholipid content will be obtained and the expression of genes involved in their synthesis at different stages of plant development .

2. QTLs will be obtained explaining the genetic architecture of phospholipid synthesis. Within two years for which it is proposing this project will be difficult to map finely potential candidates and test its function and this work would be done on possible extensions of the project.

3. Data on the differentiation of the genes involved in synthesis will be obtained phospholipids which may explain adaptation to highlands.

4. They generate mutants with altered phosphatidylcholine levels and field data that allow explore the effects of the levels of phosphatidylcholine in flowering times and the consequences in terms of adaptation to highlands are obtained.

5. It obtain data that will help check the effects of natural variation in the sequences of the genes involved in phospholipid synthesis have effects on the expression levels of genes, the contents of phospholipids and other phenotypes that are controlled by the phospholipid levels as root architecture and flowering time.
